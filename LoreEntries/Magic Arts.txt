#System of magic/power: in this world the energy is represented based on four different but coordinated pillars, these four pillars are the following:

##Regnum Tenebrarum: It is the realm where all earthly emotions and sensations have a reflection that is stored in the form of twisted magical energy, it is an inaccessible plane from which magicians extract magical energy through their soulforce (the more soulforce the more presence their soul has in the Regnum Tenebrarum and the more magic it can catalyze) used to cast their spells, due to the immense amount of suffering of the Black Century and its aftermath, most of the Regnum Tenebrorum is populated almost exclusively by magical energy derived from negative emotions, which makes it so that any mediocre magician can be easily corrupted mentally and physically by manipulating this very twisted energy.

##Soulforce: It is the magical energy possessed by the body of every living being (variable amount), you can train to have more soulforce and control it more efficiently, you can also do miscellaneous spells that do not require elemental affinity and will not require to use the connection to Regnum Tenebrorum, such as teleportation, float in the air or move objects based on weight ... Soulforce has physical effects causing twisted alterations due corruption, such as muscle hardening, increased endurance, speed and improved sensorial perception, in case of adquiring a lot more soulforce than the amount you born with, you will suffer severe corruption and this can cause physical alterations (increase in size or drastic physionomical and mental changes).

##Elemental affinity: is the natural easiness of someone to cast spells related to a certain element, such as fire, water, wind, blood, light and shadow. Normally people only have one elemental affinity, the limit of the strength of the spells is based on the soulforce you possess and the magic knowedge you have (more soulforce and more wise= more powerful spells).

##Thaumaturgy: is the application and integration of magic to technology, almost completely lost in the current era, thaumaturgy consists of enchanting armor or weapons by cursing them with twisted energy, the creation of more resistant magic metals, the creation of materials with special properties and the creation of talismans or amulets that grant advantages to the wearer by the cost of slowly corrupt their soul. Additionally there are thaumaturgical relics (old dwarf relics) of great power in remote or extremely dangerous places (relics created before or during the Black Century).
