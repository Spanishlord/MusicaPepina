#Religious Context:
Clans and packs of feral creatures roamed the lands, while those who managed to hold onto the shreds of their former lives faced the daunting task of reestablishing order after the Dark Century. From the ashes of the old, new societies began to emerge, forged in the fires of adversity and the need for survival. The knowledge of magic, once wielded so freely, became scarce and sacred in a twisted dark way, the very concept of gods is shrouded in doubt and fear.

#Religous Schisms:
Among the sapient races, the ancient religions that caused the Dark Century were rejected after the cataclysm wrought by the old gods, causing resentment towards the gods who punished and abandoned the world, the presence of the pantheon and its influence disappeared after the cataclysm and new forms of worship arose from the hand of new 'prophets' or powerful entities. three forms of cult were born after the cataclysm: Crimson Cults, Vengance Path, Warp Sects.

##Crimson Cults (Blood Cults):
Usually referred to as Blood Cults, use mainly blood elemental affinity in their rites, it's the main religion of Darkin people, it is a dark pantheon (the local number of gods vary from cult to cult), it was created by two founding deities, the very powerful archbiomancer Eztli Tenoch and his wife Yaldabaoth Ztin, an extremely powerful witch expert in Regnum Tenebrarum energies, both father and mother of a twisted doctrine that fragmented over time into numerous Blood Cults, although there is no central authority and cults can vary in size and traditions, they all share fundamental dogmas: The worship of Eztli Tenoch as a god, nicknamed 'The All Consuming Father', the worship of Yaldabaoth Ztin as a goddess, nicknamed 'The Breeder Mother of Darkness', as an additional dogma, self-mutilation is usually mandatory through ritual scars that mark the rank of the blood priest.

##Vengance Path:
It is a warrior religion shared by the Plunderians and the Greenmaw, there is no central authority or official dogma but strength is everything, war is the only path to honor and glory, thou there are some war priest but the facto religious authority is held by those who lead their clans, tribes or hordes, they are normally religious and political leaders of their respective communities, the traditions and rituals of this religion can vary greatly depending on the region and the leader in question.

##Warp Sects:
They are the most extreme sects among the new forms of worship, usually exercised by Twistedfolk, they venerate the Regnum Tenebrarum and call it 'The Warp', they believe that salvation is only achievable through the absolute corruption of body and soul, only those who have become the heart of darkness can claim paradise, so mass sacrifices, child rape, regulatory torture and cruelty are the dogmas of these sects, there was no defined deity until Mal'kata emerged, originally a poor orphaned Twistedfolk, she showed great magical talent and with a mixture of skill, discipline, treachery and cunning she climbed the ranks in her sect until she became high priestess, later she diplomatically subdued other cults and came to be revered as the sole and absolute goddess of the Warp Sects, although many renegade sects still deny her authority, most are at least nominally controlled by Mal'kata
