#Goblins: Their technology is very primitive, barely comparable to the Paleolithic (clan level), with crude tools such as flint knives, stone spears, clothing made from the fibers of dead plants or clothing made from the poorly tanned skins of small animals joined together with ligament thread. In very rare cases, goblin leaders may use rusty iron weapons (old equipment stolen or collected from ruins). Leaders or high-ranking goblins also often wear a long fur turban, a sign of their status in their clan.

#Abyssalfolk: Being feral beasts, they barely understand the concept of 'technology' and do not use clothing, armor or weapons, but in the larger packs with more plundered territory, alphas sometimes tie the carcasses of small sea creatures to their chests using a rope fashioned from kelp, demonstrating that at least one extremely small remnant of them has not completely lost the spark of intelligence.

#Greenmaws: Their technology is very primitive, their technology is currently equivalent to the Paleolithic or early Neolithic (clan or early-tribal level) but twisted and adapted to use brutality and ritual tattoos, they live in primitive settlements where strength defines rank, being the strongest the most powerful in the clan or tribe being their leaders, Greenmaws usually wear dirty and worn clothes made of tanned skins or don't wear anything at all, in very rare cases, the best warriors of the largest tribes can afford a crude bronze armor crafted by their Brokenkin slaves, the armor is made of a chestplate of bad quality tainted bronze (heavy and not so tough), to protect the chest, and some sort of crude bronze bucket as helmet.

#Ogres: They are an undead race now, have no technology and can't develop any.

#Darkin: The cataclysm swept away all their advances, leading the Darkin to an extremely dark and miserable time, their technology is currently equivalent to the Paleolithic or early Neolithic (clan or early-tribal level), they can have one or the other level, they usually wear very dirty and worn clothes made of tanned skins, in very rare cases, the best warriors of the largest tribes can afford a barely functional armor made up of two layers of tanned skins and a thin outer layer of sea creature scales held together by sinew thread (only protect the chest).

#Moltenkin: Being feral beasts, they barely understand the concept of 'technology' and do not use clothing, armor or weapons, but in the larger most succesful packs, their alphas have developed a very broken almost non-functional language of hisses, roars and grunts.

#Dragons: extinct or missing, no information know yet.

#Twistedfolk: Their technology is the most advanced amongs the other post-cataclysm civilizations, although their technological level is comparable to city-states of the classical era (disjointed and slave-based economy with little trade), they wear some sort of diry togas made of looted line (from storage ruins) or makeshift toges with whatever they suit, they are the only civilization that has a regularized academy of magic (only available to Twistedfolks), they preserve a simple and functional type of writing on scrolls, they are also the only ones that have developed philosophies after the cataclysm and the only ones that have an organized religion (the Cult of the Goddess of Flesh) founded by a great biomage (who is immortal to age), she the only central authority and unifying figure apart from the local tyrants (and their aristocracies) in their ruined city-states.

#Plunderians: The cataclysm swept away all their already backward technology, leading the Plunderians to devolve into brutal warriors with barely enough self-cotrol to not torn apart their young, their technology is currently equivalent to the paleolithic (clan level) but twisted and adapted to use brutality, bones as their currency and ritual tattoos, they live in primitive hordes where strength defines rank, being the strongest the most powerful in the horde, being their leaders, the Plunderians usually wear bloody and worn clothes made of tanned skins or don't wear anything at all, in very rare cases, the best warriors of the largest tribes can afford a terrifying functional armor made up of layers of bones held together by sinew thread (only protect the chest) and the hollow skull of a beast as helmet.

#Harpies: Being almost feral beasts, they barely understand the concept of 'technology' and do not use clothing, armor or weapons, but in the larger avian flocks with more claimed territory (and Darkin males), alphas sometimes have a feather crown made from feathers of previous flock leaders, they have developed a broken almost unintelligible language of screeches and hisses demonstrating that at least they keep a small remnant of their former intelligence.

#Brokenkin: Once the most advanced civilization, the cataclysm swept away all their advances, leading the Darkin to a invaluable lost of almost all their technology, bringhing them a very dark and miserable time, their technology is currently equivalent to the bronze age (tribal level), but their artisan prowess is still recognicent even in current times so they are valuables slaves, they usually wear dirty and worn clothes made of crude plant fibers, most of their remaining population remain in tiny communities, enslaved by Greenmaw clans or Twistedfolk city-states.
