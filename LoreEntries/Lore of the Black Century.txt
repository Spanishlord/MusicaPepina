### The Age of Unity and Prosperity
---
In the ancient realm of Irokanom, a time of harmony and prosperity reigned supreme. The land was a tapestry of diverse civilizations, each contributing to the rich fabric of the world's culture. From the grandeur of human and elven kingdoms sprawling across the fertile plains, to the bustling merchant republics of the trading coasts where goblins and kobolds haggled over exotic goods, the world was a testament to untrusty feeble collaborative spirit of the sapient races. The orks, renowned for their valor and honor, lived alongside the wise dwarfs in the mountain fortresses, while the mysterious merfolk dominated the depths of the oceans. The skies above were ruled by the graceful harpies, and the distant lands were shaped by the might of beastmen and dragons. The very essence of existence was intertwined with magic and divine energy, a symbiotic relationship that brought unparalleled advancement and wonder.

### The Onset of the Black Century
---
The tranquility of Irokanom was shattered by the cataclysmic event known as the 'Alaxikaiton.' A century of unbridled warfare and destruction, the Black Century pitted the mortal races against their own gods in a brutal struggle for dominance. The mortals had grown in power, and their hubris had not gone unnoticed by the divine beings they once revered. The gods, blinded by their own arrogance, turned their immense might against their creations, unleashing a torrent of wrath that scarred the very face of the world. This epoch of divine rage saw the once prosperous lands ravaged, civilizations toppled, and the very fabric of existence torn asunder.

### The Divine Retreat and the Descent into Chaos
---
As the Black Century drew to its bloody close, the gods, weakened by their own unbridled fury, realized the futility of their feud. In a dramatic and sudden move, they retreated from the mortal realm, leaving the survivors to grapple with the consequences of their actions. The mortal races, now without divine guidance or protection, found themselves on the brink of annihilation. Societies crumbled under the weight of the cataclysm, and many regressed to the primitive ways of the Stone Age. Others, like the orks and goblins, succumbed to the chaos, devolving into feral beings driven by instinct and survival.

### The Aftermath and the Rise of New Orders
---
The remnants of the once-great civilizations of Irokanom were forced to adapt and rebuild in the harsh post-Alaxikaiton world. Clans and packs of feral creatures roamed the lands, while those who managed to hold onto the shreds of their former lives faced the daunting task of reestablishing order. From the ashes of the old, new societies began to emerge, forged in the fires of adversity and the need for survival. The knowledge of magic, once wielded so freely, became scarce and sacred, and the very concept of gods was shrouded in doubt and fear. The world had changed irrevocably, and with it, the destiny of its inhabitants.
